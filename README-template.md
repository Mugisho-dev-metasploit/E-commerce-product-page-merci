## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid & Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla JavaScript for interactions (cart, gallery, lightbox)

### What I learned

During this project, I improved my skills in responsive web design and interactive UI development using Vanilla JavaScript.
Specifically, I implemented a dynamic product image gallery with thumbnails and a lightbox viewer for desktop users.

I also practiced writing clean logic for state management, such as cart interactions, item counting, and dynamic updates to the DOM.

Here is an example of the image switching logic:

```js
thumbnails.forEach(thumbnail => {
  thumbnail.addEventListener("click", function() {
    // Remove active class from all thumbnails
    thumbnails.forEach(t => t.classList.remove("active"));
    
    // Add active class to clicked thumbnail
    this.classList.add("active");
    
    // Update main image source
    const newImageSrc = this.getAttribute("data-image");
    mainImage.src = newImageSrc;
  });
});
```
